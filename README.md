# RuLa
A programming language for RuleSet-based quantum repeaters. *RuleSet* [^ruleset][^architecture] is a instruction set for a quantum repeater that allows us to generate reliable entanglement between end nodes.

## Design
RuLa is designed to translate higher-level discription of RuleSet into lower-level RuleSet instructions [^architecture]. The output file of RuLa is now JSON format that contains a set of RuleSet instructions.

For more details on the design decisions and system architectures, please refer to [my master thesis](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/publications/cocori_mthesis.pdf)
## Usage
RuLa requires Rust compiler ([rustc](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) that is grater than or equal version 1.63.0. For convenience, Rust package manager [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is also recommended to install to compile RuLa program.
